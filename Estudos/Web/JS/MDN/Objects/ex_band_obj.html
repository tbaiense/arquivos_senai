    In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands. The required properties are:

    name: A string representing the band name.
    nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.
    genre: What type of music the band plays.
    members: A number representing the number of members the band has.
    formed: A number representing the year the band formed.
    split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
    albums: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
        name: A string representing the name of the album.
        released: A number representing the year the album was released.
        Include at least two albums in the albums array.

    Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, 
    years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.
