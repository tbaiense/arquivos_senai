<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>ntroduction to Programming Using Java</span> is a free
introductory computer programming textbook that uses Java as the language of
instruction.  This version of the book covers Java&nbsp;17.
It is suitable for use in an introductory programming course
and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There are
no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and
programs.  There is more than enough material for a full year of college-level
programming.  Chapters 1 through 7 can be used as a textbook in a one-semester
college-level course or in a year-long high school course.  The remaining
chapters can be covered in a second course.</p>


<p>The textbook home page, 
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/</a>, 
has links for downloading both web site and PDF versions of the book.  Example programs and
solutions to end-of-chapter exercises are part of the web site download and can also be downloaded
separately.  Readers are encouraged
to download the source code for the examples and to read and run the
programs as they read the book.  Readers are also strongly encouraged
to read the exercise solutions if they want to get the most out of this book.

<p>In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it
concentrates on explaining concepts rather than giving step-by-step
how-to-do-it guides.
I have tried to use a conversational writing style that
might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. This is
certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a
comprehensive survey of all the features of Java. It is not written as
a quick introduction to Java for people who already know another programming
language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are learning
programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming
concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that <i>Introduction to
Programming using Java</i> is fully competitive with the conventionally
published, printed programming textbooks that are available on the market.
(Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.)</p>


<p>There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses
graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. And some people
believe that object oriented programming should be emphasized from the
very beginning. These are <b>not</b> the approach that I take. The approach that I favor
starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds from
there. After an introductory chapter,
I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, and&nbsp;4.
Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter&nbsp;5. Chapter&nbsp;6
covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and
graphical user interfaces. Arrays are introduced in Chapter&nbsp;3 with a full treatment in Chapter&nbsp;7.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving beyond the
fundamental ideas of programming to cover more advanced topics.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is about writing robust, correct, and efficient programs.
Chapters&nbsp;9 and 10 cover recursion and data structures, including generic programming and the Java Collection
Framework.  Chapter&nbsp;11 is about files and networking.  Chapter&nbsp;12
covers threads and parallel processing.  Finally,
Chapter&nbsp;13 returns to the topic of graphical user interface programming
to cover some more advanced features.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Java currently has two major approaches to Graphical User Interface programming:
JavaFX and Swing.  This edition of the textbook uses JavaFX,
but there is an alternative edition that uses Swing.
The main differences are in Chapters&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;13, which are devoted to GUI programming,
but GUI programs and GUI-related material
in other chapters also use JavaFX exclusively.
For the Swing edition, much of the GUI material is taken from Version&nbsp;7 of this textbook,
with some updating and modification.</p>


<p>Swing is a standard part of Java.  JavaFX was introduced as a more modern approach to
GUI programming, but it must be downloaded and installed separately from Java itself,
which makes it more complicated to use.  Swing and JavaFX can both be used to write
complex, fully functional GUI programs, and either one is a reasonable choice.  Version&nbsp;8 of
this textbook used JavaFX.  The alternative edition that uses Swing has been added
for Version&nbsp;9.</p>


<p>GUI programming was never included in the textbook as an end in itself, and it would
take another textbook to cover the topic in its entirety.  I cover GUI because it is a
great example of object-oriented programming, it lets me introduce event-driven programs,
and it lets students literally see the effect of the code that they write.  JavaFX and
Swing both offer good support for all of those purposes.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Version 8 of this textbook originally covered Java&nbsp;8, but minor updates of that
version added notes about new features in Java&nbsp;9 through Java&nbsp;16.  Version&nbsp;9 of
the book covers Java&nbsp;17.  The main change from Version&nbsp;8 is the addition of the
Swing edition.  A&nbsp;section on records has
been added to Chapter&nbsp;7. Many examples have been modified to use text blocks and
the new <span class="code">switch</span> statement syntax.  Some&nbsp;references to the general idea of
"abstraction" have been added, such as a short subsection on control abstraction in
Section&nbsp;3.1. A&nbsp;short subsection on final classes and methods has been added
to Section&nbsp;5.5.  There are also small corrections and modifications throughout.</p>


<p>The majority of this textbook is valid for Java&nbsp;8, and the book does not
cover features added after Java&nbsp;8 in as much detail.  
Note that only Java 8, 11, and&nbsp;17 are "long-term support"
releases.  When I introduce a feature
that requires Java&nbsp;11 or Java&nbsp;17, I will make note of that fact.
However, I will never refer to any of the non-long-term-support releases.</p>

<p>The first version of the book was written in 1996, and there have
been several versions since then.  Version&nbsp;9 will be the last version.
All editions are archived (at least until my retirement in December 2022
and hopefully beyond) at the following Web addresses:</p>

<b>A technical note on production:</b> The on-line and PDF versions of this
book are created from a single source, which is written largely in XML. 
To produce the
PDF version, the XML is processed into a form that can be used by the TeX
typesetting program.  In addition to
XML files, the source includes DTDs, XSLT transformations, Java source code files,
image files, a TeX macro file, and a couple of scripts that are used in processing.
The scripts work on Linux and on MacOS. I have made the complete source files available 
for download here:</p>

</p>




<p>These files were not originally meant for publication, and therefore are not very
cleanly written.  Furthermore, it requires a fair amount of expertise to use them.
However, I have had several requests for the sources and have made
them available on an "as-is" basis.  For more information about the sources and
how they are used see the <a href="README-full-source.txt">README&nbsp;file</a> from
the source download.</p>


<p>The source files for the JavaFX edition and for the Swing edition are actually
generated from a common set of source files that would be even harder to use.
If you are interested in exploring them, those ultimate source files can be
found on Github.  You can browse the files online, or you can clone
the git repository, using the following URL: </p>
